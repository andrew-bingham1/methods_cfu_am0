# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - I feel pretty good about them. The doc in the CFU covering all the methods was a bit intimidating as there are just so many but I think repeated exposure and additional context will help a lot there.   
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - After I was able to get the syntax down they were pretty easy. Definitely still at a very basic level but I am excited to see all that they can do going forward. 
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - Definitely want to know more about the byte and hex conversions and what utility they serve when writing code at a grander level
